h1. Factor Syntax Lexer for Pygments

This "Pygments":http://pygments.org/ lexer for "Factor":http://factorcode.org/ syntax highlighting has been contributed back and will be included in the agile languages lexer file @/path/to/pygments/lexers/agile.py@ starting with Pygments version 1.4. This is where I will maintain the lexer and make future improvements to be contributed back. By all means, lend me a hand...the lexer could definitely be expanded, but basic support is there.

h2. How to Use

Open up the the @agile.py@ file contained in your Pygments installation's @/pygments/lexers/@ directory and add a new section with this code. You'll also need to add "FactorLexer" to the @__all__@ array at the top of the file. After the file has been modified, you'll have to run the @_mapping.py@ file from within the @lexers/@ directory so Pygments becomes aware of the addition:

{% highlight bash-session %}
# cd /path/to/pygments/lexers/
# vim agile.py
# python ./_mapping.py
{% endhighlight %}

After that, Pygments will generate syntax highlighting for "factor" files.
