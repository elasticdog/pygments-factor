h1. Factor Syntax Lexer for Pygments

This fork of the "Pygments":http://pygments.org/ compiled languages lexer adds support for "Factor language":http://factorcode.org/ syntax highlighting. The lexer could definitely be expanded, but basic support is there.

h2. How to Use

Replace the @compiled.py@ file contained in your Pygments installation's @/pygments/lexers/@ directory. After the file has been replaced, you'll have to run the @_mapping.py@ file from within the @lexers/@ directory:

<pre><code># cd /path/to/pygments/lexers/
# python ./_mapping.py</code></pre>

After that, Pygments will generate syntax highlighting for "factor" files.
